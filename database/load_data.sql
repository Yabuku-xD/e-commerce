/*
E-commerce Database - Data Loading Script
----------------------------------------
This script handles data loading via the Python code rather than direct COPY commands,
to avoid issues with file paths.
*/

-- Record start of data loading process
INSERT INTO data_processing_log (process_name, status)
VALUES ('data_loading', 'STARTED');

-- Note: Actual data loading is handled by the Python code in data_processing.py
-- The CSV COPY commands were causing issues because PostgreSQL server needs direct access
-- to the files, which varies by installation

-- The following verification query can be run to check data after loading:
-- 
-- SELECT 'Customers' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM customers
-- UNION ALL
-- SELECT 'Products', COUNT(*) FROM products
-- UNION ALL
-- SELECT 'Orders', COUNT(*) FROM orders
-- UNION ALL
-- SELECT 'Order Items', COUNT(*) FROM order_items;
